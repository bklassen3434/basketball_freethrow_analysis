# A Biomechanical Analysis of Energy Flow in Basketball Free Throws

### Project Overview
This project, conducted as part of the **SPL x UTSPAN Data Challenge**, aims to analyze and optimize energy transfer during basketball free throw attempts. Understanding how energy is transferred during a free throw is crucial because efficient energy transfer can maximize shooting accuracy and reduce fatigue, while inefficient energy transfer can lead to performance issues and increase the risk of injury. The project is structured in three phases: visualizing energy transfer, analyzing inefficiencies and stress points, and applying modeling techniques to optimize the process. The data was provided by **Maple Leaf Sports and Entertainment**, capturing body movements through markerless, computer vision technology.
